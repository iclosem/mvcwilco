mvcwilco
========
This site was made for a class project.  Instead of building the database in Microsoft Access I opted to create an MVC Application that would handle everything.  The site is currently hosted at: http://mvcwilco.azurewebsites.net

Functions:
-Track projects
-Track Employee hours
-Track Customers (Would like to add more functionality to this)

Reports:
-EEOC hours (minority/female status)
-Weekly Hours (overtime/regular)
-List of project by customer
-Employee payroll (Payroll taxes are guesstimated for now.  In a real world application you can tie this in with an API)

Any questions, shoot me an e-mail at: i.closem@gmail.com
